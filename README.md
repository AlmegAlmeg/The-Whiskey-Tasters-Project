# The Whiskey Tasters
Welcome to HackerU's final project. This is a part of what I've learnt in 7 months.

The Whiskey Tasters is a website for whiskey lovers. Users can see what other people think about
any kind of whiskey, comment and like it. Reviewers are regular users that can also add their
own reviews about any whiskey they've tasted in their life.
